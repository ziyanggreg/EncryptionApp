Features: 
User-friendly GUI with clear instructions.
Encryption and decryption using a user-provided key.
Uses the AES, ARC4, or DES3 encryption algorithms for secure encryption
Supports encryption and decryption of any file type.

Getting Started: 
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies listed in the 'requirements.txt' file using 'pip install -r requirements.txt'.
Run the program by executing the 'encryption_app.py' file.
